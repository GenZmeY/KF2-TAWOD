[h1]üìã Description:[/h1]
A small server-side mutator that changes the default behavior by forcing players to drop all their weapons on death (instead of just the current weapon).

[h1]‚ùå Whitelisted?[/h1]
No. This mod is not whitelisted and will de-rank your server. Any XP earned will not be saved.

But I hope that it will be whitelisted - I submitted whitelist request here:

[h1]‚òëÔ∏è Status: Completed[/h1]
‚úîÔ∏è The mutator works with the current version of the game (v1150) and I have implemented everything I planned.
‚õîÔ∏è Development has stopped: I no longer have the time or motivation to maintain this mod. No further updates or bug fixes are planned.
